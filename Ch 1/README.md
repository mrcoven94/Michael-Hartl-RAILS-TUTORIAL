Chapter 1 - From zero to deploy
==================

What we learned in this chapter

- Ruby on Rails is a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language.
- Installing Rails, generating an application, and editing the resulting files is easy using a pre-configured cloud environment.
- Rails comes with a command-line command called rails that can generate new applications (rails new) and run local servers (rails server).
- We added a controller action and modified the root route to create a “hello, world” application.
- We protected against data loss while enabling collaboration by placing our application source code under version control with Git and pushing the resulting code to a private repository at Bitbucket.
- We deployed our application to a production environment using Heroku.
